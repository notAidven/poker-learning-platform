 * Lesson 3 — "Flow of a Hand" (design doc §6, Lesson 3; research file
 * `docs/poker-research/02-hand-flow-and-betting.md`).
 *
 * Teaches blinds + the button, the four streets, position & action order
 * (incl. the heads-up exception), and showdown (best hand wins, reveal order,
 * fold-to-one, all-in). The `board-dealer` widget carries the street walkthrough,
 * the "what's your best hand now?" beats, and the showdown "who won?" decision
 * (hero vs a revealed villain, graded by the hand evaluator); `compare-events`
 * handles the discrete who-acts-when decisions. 9 problems / 12 steps (75%).
